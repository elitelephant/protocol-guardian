# Scoring Analysis & Balance

## Current Score Analysis

### Score Range Analysis (per decision):
- **Most Positive**: +20 (several decisions)
- **Most Negative**: -15 (a few decisions)
- **Average Positive**: ~+13
- **Average Negative**: ~-8

### Issues with Current Scoring:
1. **Unbalanced totals**: Some decisions heavily favor one choice
2. **Inconsistent ranges**: Score changes vary from 5 to 20 points
3. **No neutral consequences**: Every choice affects all metrics differently

## BALANCED SCORING SYSTEM

### Scoring Rules:
1. **Total impact per decision**: ¬±15 points distributed across metrics
2. **Balanced choices**: Both approve/reject should have similar total impact
3. **Trade-offs**: Each choice has pros and cons, no "perfect" option
4. **Consistent ranges**: Changes between 3-8 points per metric
