### Crisis Resolution Mechanics
Crises use a hybrid system combining **Mandatory Resolution Points** and **Metric Degradation** to create escalating urgency without rigid time limits:

#### Mandatory Resolution Points
- Each crisis must be addressed by the end of its era (e.g., Era 1 crisis resolved before Era 1 ends).
- This provides clear narrative deadlines aligned with Bitcoin's evolutionary phases.

#### Metric Degradation
- If a crisis remains unresolved past its mandatory point, consequences worsen progressively.
- **Degradation Rate**: -5 points per era segment to the affected metric(s) (e.g., Network Health for mining-related crises).
- **Accumulation**: Penalties compound until the crisis is resolved (e.g., -5 at Era 1 end, -10 at Era 2 start, etc.).
- **Resolution Window**: Players can resolve crises anytime, but delays increase long-term penalties.

#### Examples
- **Mining Centralization Crisis** (Era 1): Unresolved → Network Health -5 at Era 1 end, -10 at Era 2 start, etc.
- **Stacks Security Crisis** (Era 4): Unresolved → Network Health -5 at Era 4 end, potentially triggering early termination if Network Health < 20.

#### Gameplay Impact
- **Strategic Depth**: Rewards proactive decision-making while allowing flexibility for delayed responses.
- **Risk/Reward**: Quick resolutions maintain high metrics; delays risk early termination or "Disruptive" endings.
- **Educational Tie-in**: Reflects real Bitcoin governance challenges where consensus takes time but inaction has consequences.

### Early Termination Mechanics
Certain sample events or unresolved crises can trigger premature game endings if metrics drop critically low:
- **Network Collapse**: If Network Health reaches 0 or below 20 due to severe events or unresolved crises (e.g., mining centralization or quantum threats)
- **Public Distrust**: If Public Confidence reaches 0 or below 15 due to prolonged negative events or delayed crisis resolution
- **Innovation Stagnation**: If Tech Advancement reaches 0 or below 10 due to restrictive decisions or unresolved crises

Unresolved crises accumulate metric degradation (e.g., -5 Network Health per era segment) until resolved. Early endings result in "Disruptive" outcomes, emphasizing the fragility of decentralized systems.
