# UI Redesign - Binary Decision Interface

This folder contains the new UI/UX approach inspired by binary decision games.

## Key Changes from Original:
- **Binary decisions**: Approve/Reject instead of multiple choices
- **Simplified flat design**: Clean 2D interface, no shadows or 3D effects
- **Orange + Gray color scheme**: #FF8C00 orange with clean grays
- **Button-based interaction**: Simple click instead of drag & drop
- **Desktop-focused**: Mobile users get redirect message

## Files:
- `prototype-ui.html` - Working prototype demonstrating the new interface
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps:
1. Adapt game scenarios to binary yes/no decisions
2. Integrate this UI approach into the main Next.js app
3. Update game logic to handle binary decisions
4. Polish and test

## Testing:
Open `prototype-ui.html` in a desktop browser to test the interface.
