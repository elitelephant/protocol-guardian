# Protocol Guardian - Next.js Version

Modern implementation of the Protocol Guardian blockchain governance simulation game built with Next.js 14, React, and TypeScript.

## 🎮 Game Overview

As a Protocol Guardian, you'll face 8 critical decisions that affect three key metrics:
- **Security**: Protocol safety and vulnerability management
- **Decentralization**: Network distribution and community governance 
- **Adoption**: User growth and ecosystem expansion

Each decision leads to different endings based on your leadership style.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Best Practices

This project follows modern web development best practices:

```

### Code Organization
- **Modular JavaScript**: ES6 modules with clear separation of concerns
- **External Stylesheets**: No inline CSS, organized by function
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper accessibility attributes and structure
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags, Open Graph, and proper heading hierarchy

### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
- Skip navigation links
- Semantic HTML structure
- High contrast design

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
This project is optimized for Vercel deployment:

1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically with `vercel.json` configuration

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use any static file server
npx http-server public -p 3000 -o
```

### Manual Deployment
The project consists of static files and can be deployed to any web server:
- Upload the entire project folder
- Ensure the server can serve static files
- Point to `public/index.html` as the entry point

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

## 📖 Development Notes

This game was built as a prototype for exploring binary decision mechanics in blockchain governance scenarios. The modular architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new decision scenarios
- Modify ending conditions
- Extend the UI components
- Integrate with existing Next.js applications

The code is designed to be maintainable, accessible, and deployable across multiple platforms.
