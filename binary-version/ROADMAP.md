# Protocol Guardian - Stacks Edition Development Roadmap

*Created: October 13, 2025*  
*Target: Stacks Vibe Coding Hackathon - https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/stacks-vibe-coding/detail*  
*Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend complete, smart contract deployment needed*

## üö® URGENT: Smart Contract Implementation Required

**Current State**: The game has a complete UI for NFT minting, but **NO ACTUAL SMART CONTRACT** is deployed.

**Critical Missing Components**:
- Clarity smart contract for NFT certificates
- Real blockchain minting (currently simulated)  
- On-chain game state storage
- IPFS metadata integration

**Impact**: Users see "mint NFT" functionality but nothing actually mints to the blockchain.

## Hackathon Context

This project previously **won the Base Batches 001 hackathon** in the Vibe Coding track and participated in IncuBase (Base's incubation program). Now we're adapting it for **Stacks Vibe Coding** to showcase Bitcoin Layer 2 governance and education.

### Key Differentiation from Ethereum Version
- **Bitcoin/Stacks Focus**: Scenarios adapted to Bitcoin's evolution and Stacks ecosystem
- **Educational Value**: Teaching Bitcoin history, Layer 2 scaling, and Stacks smart contracts
- **Stacks.js Integration**: Wallet connection for progress saving and achievements
- **Simplified UX**: Intuitive flow suitable for Bitcoin newcomers

## üö® CRITICAL REALITY CHECK - Smart Contract Status

**IMPORTANT**: The NFT features are **FRONTEND ONLY** - no smart contract is deployed yet!

### What's Actually Working:
‚úÖ **Wallet Integration**: Full Stacks wallet connection (Leather, Xverse)  
‚úÖ **Game Progress**: Saves to localStorage with wallet address  
‚úÖ **Achievement System**: Notifications and tracking (local storage)  
‚úÖ **NFT UI**: Complete certificate preview and minting interface  

### What's NOT Working (Simulated Only):
‚ùå **Smart Contract**: No Clarity contract deployed to Stacks testnet/mainnet  
‚ùå **Real NFT Minting**: Currently simulated with console.log and localStorage  
‚ùå **True Blockchain State**: Progress saved locally, not on-chain  
‚ùå **Cross-Device Sync**: Only works if localStorage accessible  

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Frontend Ready Status

The binary-version is now a **complete frontend implementation** featuring:
- **10 Bitcoin/Stacks scenarios** (Lightning, PoX, DeFi, NFTs, Bridge) 
- **Enhanced 3-metric system** with segmented progress bars
- **4 Stacks governance archetypes** (Security Guardian, Ecosystem Catalyst, etc.)
- **Stacks visual branding** with circular backgrounds and hover effects
- **Professional UI/UX** with rounded corners, shadows, and smooth animations
- **Accessibility features** & desktop optimization
- **Static export** ready for Vercel deployment
- **Comprehensive documentation** for judges and future development

### NEW: Full Stacks Blockchain Integration (October 13, 2025)
- **Stacks.js Wallet Connection** - Leather, Xverse, and all Stacks wallets supported
