## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
This project is optimized for Vercel deployment:

1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically with `vercel.json` configuration

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (includes Stacks.js packages)
npm install

# Start development server (uses Stacks testnet)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm start
```

### Wallet Setup for Development
1. Install **Leather Wallet** browser extension
2. Create or import a Stacks testnet wallet
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and click "Connect Wallet"
4. Approve connection to start using blockchain features

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Automatically uses Stacks Testnet for safe testing
- **Production**: Uses Stacks Mainnet for real transactions

### Manual Deployment
The project exports to static files and can be deployed to any web server:
- Run `npm run build` to generate the `out/` directory
- Upload the contents of the `out/` folder to your web server
- The `index.html` file in `out/` is the entry point

## Deployment Checklist

- **Separated CSS**: All styles in external files
- **Modular JavaScript**: ES6 modules with proper imports
- **Proper File Structure**: Organized src/ and public/ directories
- **SEO Meta Tags**: Title, description, Open Graph tags

## ðŸ“– Development Notes

This game was built as a prototype for exploring binary decision mechanics in blockchain governance scenarios. The modular architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new decision scenarios
- Modify ending conditions
- Extend the UI components
- Integrate with existing Next.js applications

The code is designed to be maintainable, accessible, and deployable across multiple platforms.
