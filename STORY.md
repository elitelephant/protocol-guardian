   - Public Confidence: -15 (Public very concerned about criminal activity)
   - Western Alliance: -25 (Strongly disapproves)
   - Global South: +15 (Appreciates privacy protection)

**Educational Content**: Privacy coins use advanced cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and stealth addresses to hide transaction details while maintaining blockchain integrity. The regulatory challenge is balancing legitimate privacy needs with law enforcement requirements.

#### Sample Events in Year 1
- **Major Exchange Hack** (Month 1, Market Stability 0-70): CryptoGlobal Exchange hack exposes 2.3M accounts, $500M stolen. Calls for enhanced security standards.

### Year 5: 2039-2040 - Consolidation and Legacy

#### Ongoing Decisions
Throughout the final year, you continue to face regulatory challenges and must balance your accumulated relationships and metrics to achieve a favorable ending.

## Regular Decisions (Non-Crisis)

### Stablecoin Reserve Requirements
**Scenario**: Major stablecoins are experiencing volatility due to unclear reserve backing. The market demands regulatory clarity on reserve requirements and auditing standards.

**Options**:
1. **Mandate 100% fiat currency reserves with monthly audits**
   - Market Stability: +15
   - Tech Advancement: -5
   - Western Alliance: +10

2. **Allow diversified reserves including government bonds and commercial paper**

   - Market Stability: -10
   - Public Confidence: -15

**Educational Content**: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain stable value relative to a reference asset, typically the US dollar. They serve as crucial infrastructure for DeFi protocols and cross-border payments, but their stability depends on proper reserve management and regulatory oversight.

### DeFi Protocol Licensing Framework
**Scenario**: Decentralized Finance protocols are operating without clear regulatory status. Some offer traditional financial services but claim to be fully decentralized and beyond regulatory reach.

**Options**:
1. **Require all DeFi protocols to obtain traditional financial licenses**
   - Public Confidence: +20
   - Tech Advancement: -20
   - Eastern Bloc: +15

2. **Implement risk-based regulation focusing on protocol governance and user protection**
   - Market Stability: +10
   - Tech Advancement: +5
   - Public Confidence: +5

3. **Maintain current regulatory uncertainty, allowing market-driven solutions**
   - Tech Advancement: +25
   - Market Stability: -15
   - Global South: +10

**Educational Content**: DeFi protocols use smart contracts to recreate traditional financial services like lending, trading, and insurance without traditional intermediaries. The challenge is determining how to regulate code-based systems that may have no central authority.

## Ending Conditions

Your final score and ending type depend on your accumulated metrics and relationships:

- **Authoritarian**: High Western Alliance + Eastern Bloc relationships, low Tech Advancement
- **Libertarian**: High Tech Advancement, low regulatory relationships
- **Balanced**: Moderate scores across all metrics
